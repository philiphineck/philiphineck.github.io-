## ‚ú® Selected Projects

* **Packet Tracer: Investigate the TCP/IP and OSI Models in Action** - This project is a hands-on simulation activity using Cisco Packet Tracer, designed to explore and visualize the TCP/IP protocol suite and its relationship to the OSI model. My role involved configuring and observing network traffic, specifically HTTP and DNS, within the simulation environment to understand concepts like data encapsulation, PDU (Protocol Data Unit) inspection, and the function of different layers. The key technology used is Cisco Packet Tracer. [Link to Repository](https://github.com/philiphineck/Packet-Tracer-_Investigate-the-TCP_IP-and-OSI-Models-in-Action)
* **Wireshark Activity : Use Wireshark to View Network Traffic** - Wireshark is a valuable tool in networking because it is used to troubleshoot networks, analyze network traffic, develop Software and protocols, and educate network enthusiasts. As traffic is transmitted over the network, Wireshark captures each Protocol Data Unit (PDU) and can decode and analyze its content.
